Product Requirements Document (PRD): FraudWatch
Enterprise Fraud Detection System
 Target Industry: Banking / Financial Services
________________


1. Executive Summary
Objective:
 Develop FraudWatch, a real-time fraud detection system leveraging TensorFlow to:
* Reduce false positives by 40%
* Detect 99% of fraudulent transactions in enterprise banking workflows
Compliance:
 The system will adhere to GDPR, PCI DSS, SOX, and CCPA standards.
Key Metrics:
* Precision: > 95%
* Recall: > 98%
* Latency: < 200 ms per transaction
Industry Alignment:
 FraudWatch’s design aligns with best practices from Capital One’s FDRS and PayPal’s fraud detection frameworks, leveraging TensorFlow’s scalability for enterprise-grade deployments.
________________


2. Scope & Features
In-Scope:
* Real-time payment fraud detection (ACH, wire, card)
* Account takeover prevention (behavioral biometrics)
* Seamless integration with core banking systems (e.g., Fiserv, Temenos)
Out-of-Scope:
* Check fraud detection (planned for phase 2)
* Cross-institutional fraud linking (requires future partnerships)
________________


3. Technical Requirements
Data Pipeline
Sources:
* Transactional databases (SQL Server, Oracle)
* User behavior logs (Kafka streams)
* External APIs (Socure for identity verification)
Preprocessing:
* Class imbalance handled via TensorFlow Data Validation (TFDV)
* Outlier detection using Mahalanobis distance
Model Architecture
Core Model:
* Hybrid Autoencoder + Gradient Boosted Trees

   * Autoencoder (Unsupervised):

      * Detects anomalies via reconstruction error
      * Architecture: 64-32-16-32-64 (5 layers)
      * GBM Classifier (Supervised):

         * Captures feature importance (e.g., transaction frequency)
         * Integrated via TensorFlow Extended (TFX)
Sample (Python):
python
RunCopy
# Hybrid model architecture (TensorFlow)
autoencoder = tf.keras.Sequential([...])  # Encoder-decoder
gbm_model = tfdf.keras.GradientBoostedTreesModel()


# Combined inference
def predict_fraud(transaction):
    reconstruction_loss = autoencoder(transaction)
    gbm_score = gbm_model(transaction)
    return 0.7 * reconstruction_loss + 0.3 * gbm_score

APIs
         * REST endpoint for real-time scoring (FastAPI)
         * Batch inference for historical analysis
________________


4. Implementation Plan
Phase 1: Data Preparation (Weeks 1–3)
         * Ingest 12 months historical transactions (~5M/day)
         * Label fraud cases using chargeback records
         * Generate synthetic fraud samples with TF-GAN
         * Deliverable: Cleaned dataset with 120 engineered features (e.g., time_since_last_login)
Phase 2: Model Training
         * Train autoencoder on non-fraud data (MSE loss)
         * Tune GBM via TFX Tuner on labeled data
         * Validate models via time-series split (prevent data leakage)
Tools:
         * MLflow: Experiment tracking
         * TensorFlow Serving: Dockerized deployment
________________


5. Monitoring & Maintenance
Alert Dashboard:
         * Grafana + Prometheus for metrics
Metrics Monitored:
         * Daily fraud volume
         * Model drift (KL divergence between training/inference distributions)
Retraining Strategy:
         * Weekly retraining with new data
         * Canary deployments for model version comparison
________________


6. Security & Compliance
         * Data Encryption: AES-256 at rest; TLS 1.3 in transit
         * Access Control: RBAC via Azure Active Directory
         * Audit Trail: All predictions logged; SHAP explanations for transparency
________________


7. Risk Mitigation
         * Cold Start: Use pre-trained embeddings from Swift network data
         * False Positives: Fallback to rules engine (e.g., auto-approve transactions < $500)
________________


8. Additional Notes
         * Alignment: PRD follows frameworks from Capital One FDRS and PayPal, leveraging TensorFlow’s scalability.
         * Thresholds and retraining frequency will be refined based on pilot results.
